## Me

I'm Caleb Hoover. I write websites and stuff.

I've been coding since mid 2010 and have dabbled in dotnet, java game dev, and websites. I've mainly been focusing on websites and have been since 2014. 

I have an active interest of writing code for people and myself in the form of scripts and websites. I like taking parts of my life and automating them.

My big fascination right now is writing websites for my niche hobby of [cubing](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/). 

## Letscube

My biggest website is [letscube](https://github.com/coder13/letscube) which hosts almost 5000 registered users. This platform connects [cubers](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/) together and lets them race eachoher solving rubik's cubes.

## Career Hunting

I'm graduating in March of 2022 and am actively looking for employment after graduation. I'm open to anything software related leaning towards web development.

## Funfacts

 - My language of choice is Javascript
 - My database of choice is MongoDB and MySQL when applicable
 - The fastest I've solved a rubik's cubes in 6.34 seconds
 - Electronic music is my favorite music genre
