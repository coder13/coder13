<!-- Hi -->

## Me

I'm Cailyn Hoover. I make cool software.

I've been coding since mid 2010 and have dabbled in dotnet, java game dev, and websites. I've mainly been focusing on websites and have been since 2014. 

I have an enthusiastic interest in writing code for people and myself. I like taking parts of my life and automating them.

My big fascination right now is writing websites for my niche hobby of [cubing](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/). 
I run WCA competitions. I have developed various tools for managing them:
- [Delegate-Dashboard](https://github.com/coder13/delegateDashboard): WCA Competition Groups Management Tool
- [Competitor-Groups](https://github.com/coder13/Competitor-groups): WCA Competition Groups Viewing Tool
- [WCA-Regs](https://github.com/coder13/wcaregs): Combines WCA Regulations and Guidelines into a single searchable page

I'm hapily employed at [Circle](https://www.circle.com/en/). Come work for us!

## Letscube

My biggest website is [letscube](https://github.com/coder13/letscube) which hosts over 8000 registered users. This platform connects [cubers](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/) together and lets them race eachoher solving rubik's cubes.

## Funfacts

 - My language of choice is Javascript
 - The fastest I've solved a rubik's cube is 6.34 seconds
 - I've been to 50+ WCA Sanctioned competitions putting on almost half of them
 - I'm also the lead delegate for the PNW
 - Electronic music is my favorite music genre
