<!-- Hi -->

## Me

I'm Cailyn Hoover. I make people's lives easier through software.

I've been coding since mid 2010 and have dabbled in dotnet, java game dev, and websites. I've mainly been focusing on websites and have been since 2014. 

I have an enthusiastic interest in writing code for people and myself. I like taking parts of my life and automating them.

My big fascination right now is writing websites for my niche hobby of [cubing](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/). 

You may have heard of [letscube](https://github.com/coder13/letscube), a webapp that connects cubers together to race in real time powered by nodejs, websockets, and react.

I run WCA competitions. I have developed various tools for managing them:
- [Delegate-Dashboard](https://github.com/coder13/delegateDashboard): WCA Competition Groups Management Tool
- [Competitor-Groups](https://github.com/coder13/Competitor-groups): WCA Competition Groups Viewing Tool
- [WCA-Regs](https://github.com/coder13/wcaregs): Combines WCA Regulations and Guidelines into a single searchable page

I'm hapily employed at [Circle](https://www.circle.com/en/). Come work for us!

## Software

- My most used website is [CompetitionGroups.com](https://www.competitiongroups.com/) providing competitors of WCA-sanctioned competitions view of personal schedules and event information used by over 100,000 competitors and attendees across the world.
- My proudest website is [letscube](https://github.com/coder13/letscube) which hosts over 10,000 registered users. This platform connects [cubers](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/) together and connecting Rubik's cube solvers with the ability to race in real time

## Funfacts

 - My language of choice is Javascript
 - The fastest I've solved a rubik's cube is 6.19 seconds
 - I've been to 100+ WCA Sanctioned competitions putting on almost half of them
 - I'm also the lead delegate for the PNW
 - Electronic music is my favorite music genre
